# Natours Project

This is the first project of Jonas Schmedtmann's "Advanced CSS and Sass" course on Udemy. I mostly replicated the project exactly as instructed, aside from using Gulp for various tasks (watch, Sass compiling, final build), which was not included in the course (Jonas does these tasks from the JSON file, which I opted not to follow). 

I treated the project mostly as a playground for practicing various advanced CSS techniques, so some aspects of the design were not perfected (e.g., responsive images, extensive browser support testing, etc.).
